        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online courses have been a part of education for some time now. While we haven't seen massive adoption in colleges and universities, online platforms are making it easier than ever to learn new skills, achieve certifications and advance your career. And that's pretty exciting for all of us who may not have attended (or completed) college. But what exactly can we learn from online courses? How do they compare to traditional learning methods? And where does one turn to get started with an online education? Let's take a look at some of these questions and explore how online learning is changing education.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In recent years, online education has exploded in popularity. If you’re not already enrolled in an online course or two, chances are you know someone who is. Whether it’s for school or professional development, more and more students are making good use of educational platforms to learn what they need to know. What does that mean for your average classroom? Well, it may be a big deal—the future of education is here.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Use Technology To Help</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Today, students are just as likely to be in college taking online courses as they are to be attending classes in person. This means teachers can work at home, in another city or even a different country. In fact, learning online has become so popular that half of all students and three-quarters of teachers say online classes are just as effective as traditional ones. That's why more than 1 million students were enrolled in free online courses offered by major universities last year. Whether you're seeking a degree or taking a class for personal interest, you can learn anything from anyone on almost any topic with Internet access and some dedication.</p>
